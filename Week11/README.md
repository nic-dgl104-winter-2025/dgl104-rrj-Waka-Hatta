### **Class Content** ********************************************************
#### **OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**

[1] Classes
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines attributes and methods, and objects are created based on this class.
While the class provides the basic structure, each object can be further customized.

[2] Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of hiding data and methods within the object, making them inaccessible from outside.
It prevents unexpected changes and keeps the program safe.
If you’ve used the keyword private in any language, you’ve already encountered encapsulation.

[3] Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (the child) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (the parent).
This helps reduce code duplication and build efficient structures.
Child classes can add unique features while reusing common functionality from the parent.

[4] Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to act as different types.
For example, the same object can behave like its parent class or grandparent class, depending on the situation.
This allows flexible behavior in programs.

#### **What is a Programming Paradigm?** - A programming paradigm is a way of classifying programming languages based on their features.

1. Imperative Programming
OOP belongs to this paradigm.
Describes how the program should perform computations.
Examples: if statements, switch, for loops, while loops, etc.
2. Declarative Programming
Focuses on what the program should do rather than how to do it.
Example: Functional Programming
Common functions: map, reduce, flatMap, compact, etc.
In modern mobile development, declarative UI frameworks are becoming popular:
  - Android → Jetpack Compose
  - iOS → SwiftUI
  Both are designed to describe what the UI should do instead of how to do it.

3. Prototypal Programming
Common in JavaScript.
Instead of classes, JavaScript creates objects based on prototypes.
Most JS developers don’t worry about prototypes, but learning about them can be beneficial.


#### **What are the SOLID Principles?**
SOLID is an acronym for the following five design principles:
  - S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
  - L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - A class should have only one reason to change.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)】
  - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
  - Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

    3-1.User Interface (UI): Screens and buttons that users interact with.
    
    3-2.Programming Interface: Like the interface keyword in Java, connecting classes and modules.
