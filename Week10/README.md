#### **MV* PATTERNS**



[1] MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
   - MVVM is a UI-based architectural pattern similar to MVC but focuses on data binding.
   - he Model contains business logic and data.
   - The View is responsible for UI representation.
   - The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and View without directly referencing the View.
   - Data Binding is a key feature, reducing boilerplate code and improving efficiency.
   - MVVM is particularly useful when real-time data updates are required.
   - It is widely used in modern Android development, Swift UI, and web frameworks like Vue, Angular, and React.

[2] MVC (Model-View-Controller)
   - MVC is another UI architectural pattern.
   - The Model handles data, storage, and business logic.
   - The View presents data but does not store or process it.
   - The Controller manages interactions between Model and View.
   - MVC is common in web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, Angular, and Vue.
   - While historically used in iOS and Android, it has been largely replaced by MVVM for modern mobile development.
