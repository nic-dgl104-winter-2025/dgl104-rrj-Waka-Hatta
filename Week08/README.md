## Week 8 (February 25)
### **Class Content** 

#### **User Stories:
Written in natural language, e.g., "As a user, I can upload a profile picture."
Help teams align on the appâ€™s behavior and goals.
Good for communication but lack technical details.
Might miss performance needs or non-functional requirements like speed.

#### **Technical Design Document (TDD):
A higher-level guide covering technical approaches, chosen technologies, and architecture (like MV* patterns).
Includes testing plans and performance expectations.
Useful in early development stages but often outdated once coding starts.

#### **Functional Requirements:
Describe app features as input-output relationships, similar to functions in programming.
Often derived from user stories or use cases.
Provide clarity on how data moves and transforms within the app.


### **Required research** 
#### **RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE to the Slack
I researched about Lua.
Lua is a programming language originally developed to be embedded in C programs, and as a scripting language, it is known for its high execution speed. Lua is often used in game development and plugin development. One of Lua's unique characteristics is that it is frequently utilized as an embedded language within other applications. For example, in game development, parts that require high-speed processing are implemented in C, while Lua is used for scripting scenarios and sections that need to be flexibly modified. The main features of Lua include easy embeddability, high extensibility, being free software, and fast execution speed.

#### **WRITE A USER STORY to the Slack
Hana, a junior high school student, wants to start learning English from the basics, which will help her in her future studies and travels. Duolingo allows her to learn English from the basics in a game-like way, and the ranking function helps her stay motivated and continue.
John, a busy working professional, wants to practice business English in a short amount of time, which will improve his communication with overseas clients. He uses Duolingo's Business English category to practice listening during his commute, and on weekends he practices business conversation through role-playing.
